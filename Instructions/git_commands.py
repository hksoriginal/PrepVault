# Adds and commits tracked files in one step with a message

git rm [file]
# Deletes the file from your working directory and stages the deletion

git mv [file-original] [file-renamed]

## 4. Branching and Merging
```bash
git branch

git branch [branch-name]
# Creates a new branch

git checkout [branch-name]
# Switches to the specified branch

git checkout -b [branch-name]
# Creates and switches to a new branch

git merge [branch]
# Combines the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch

git branch -d [branch-name]

## 5. Inspecting a Repository
```bash
git log
# Shows the commit history for the repository

git log --oneline
# Shows a compressed version of the commit history

git diff
# Shows the differences between the working directory and the staging area

git show [commit]

## 6. Rewriting History
```bash

git revert [commit]
# Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of the specified commit

git commit --amend
# Modifies the most recent commit with a new message or additional changes

git remote add origin [url]
# Adds a remote repository URL to your local repository

git fetch
# Downloads commits, files, and references from a remote repository

git pull
# Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into the current branch

git push
# Uploads local repository content to a remote repository

git push origin [branch-name]
# Pushes the specified branch to the remote repository
```

## 8. Stashing Changes
```bash
git stash
# Temporarily saves changes that are not yet ready to be committed

git stash list
# Shows a list of stashed changes

## 9. Advanced Git Commands
```bash
git rebase [branch]

git cherry-pick [commit]
