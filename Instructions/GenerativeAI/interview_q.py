# Generative AI Interview Questions and Answers

###  What is Generative AI?
**Answer**:  
Generative AI refers to systems that use machine learning models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), or Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT), to generate new content like text, images, audio, or video. It learns patterns and structures from the training data to create outputs that mimic human-like creativity.

---

###  How do GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) work?
**Answer**:  
GANs consist of two neural networks:  
1. **Generator**: Creates synthetic data samples.  
2. **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and synthetic data.  
Both networks are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game: the generator improves to create more realistic samples, while the discriminator gets better at identifying fake samples.

- **Task-specific Metrics**: Depending on the application, specific benchmarks may apply (e.g., perplexity for language models).  


### Can you explain the differences between Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) and Variational Autoencoders(VAEs)?
Answer: GANs consist of two networks—a generator and a discriminator—competing in a game where the generator tries to produce realistic data while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. VAEs, on the other hand, are probabilistic models that learn a latent variable representation of the data and use it to generate new samples. GANs often produce sharper images but can be more challenging to train, while VAEs are generally more stable but might produce blurrier images.

### What are the key components of a GAN architecture, and how do they interact during training?
Answer: A GAN architecture includes a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates fake data samples, while the discriminator evaluates them against real data samples to determine authenticity. During training, the generator tries to improve its data generation to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish between real and fake data. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that the discriminator can no longer reliably classify as fake.

### How does the concept of latent space function in generative models, and why is it important?
Answer: Latent space is a lower-dimensional representation of the data learned by the model. In generative models, it allows for encoding complex data distributions into a more manageable form. For example, in VAEs, the latent space captures the underlying factors of variation in the data, enabling the generation of new samples by sampling from this space. It is crucial for controlling the generation process and exploring variations in generated outputs.

### What are some common techniques to improve the stability and performance of GANs?
Answer: Techniques to improve GAN stability and performance include using different architectures such as Deep Convolutional GANs(DCGANs) or Wasserstein GANs(WGANs). Incorporating techniques like batch normalization, feature matching, and gradient penalty can also help stabilize training. Additionally, employing advanced optimizers and loss functions designed specifically for GANs can improve performance.

### Can you explain the purpose and implementation of regularization techniques in generative models?
Answer: Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting and improve generalization. In generative models, common techniques include dropout, weight decay, and spectral normalization. Regularization can be implemented by adding noise to the inputs or weights, penalizing large weights, or normalizing the spectral norm of weight matrices. These methods ensure that the model learns robust features and avoids memorizing the training data.

### How do attention mechanisms enhance the performance of generative models, particularly in sequence generation tasks?
Answer: Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on different parts of the input sequence dynamically, improving the generation of sequential data. In models like transformers, attention mechanisms enable the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the sequence, leading to better context understanding and more coherent generation of text or sequences. This capability is crucial for tasks such as language translation or text generation.

### What are the key differences between conditional GANs(cGANs) and traditional GANs?
Answer: Conditional GANs extend traditional GANs by conditioning the generation process on additional information, such as class labels or attributes. This allows cGANs to generate data that adheres to specific conditions or categories. In contrast, traditional GANs generate data without any conditioning, leading to less control over the generated output.

### How do you implement and tune the loss functions for generative models, and why is this important?
Answer: Loss functions are crucial for guiding the training of generative models. For GANs, the loss functions for the generator and discriminator are designed to optimize the adversarial game between them. For VAEs, the loss function combines reconstruction loss and KL divergence to balance data fidelity and latent space regularization. Tuning loss functions involves adjusting weights and parameters to ensure balanced training and avoid issues like mode collapse or poor convergence.

### What are diffusion models, and how do they compare to traditional generative models?
Answer: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that generate data by gradually denoising samples from a noise distribution. They work by iteratively refining noisy data through a series of denoising steps. Compared to traditional models like GANs and VAEs, diffusion models often produce high-quality and diverse samples but may require longer training times and more computational resources.

### How do you evaluate the performance of a generative model, and what metrics are commonly used?
Answer: The performance of generative models is evaluated using a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Common metrics include Fréchet Inception Distance(FID), Inception Score(IS), and BLEU score for text generation. Qualitative evaluation involves human judgment to assess the realism and relevance of generated samples. Combining these methods provides a comprehensive view of model performance

### Describe a project where you applied generative models to solve a real-world problem. What was the outcome?
Answer: In a project aimed at enhancing customer support, I applied a generative model to create a chatbot that could generate contextually relevant responses. By training the model on historical interaction data, we improved response accuracy and user engagement. The chatbot significantly reduced the need for human intervention and increased customer satisfaction through more natural and personalized interactions.



### When should you fine-tune the LLM vs. using RAG?

In the world of LLMs, choosing between fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) depends on the specific needs and constraints of your application.

* **Fine-tuning** customizes a pretrained LLM for a specific domain by updating most or all of its parameters with a domain-specific dataset. This approach is resource-intensive but yields high accuracy for specialized use cases.
* **PEFT** modifies a pretrained LLM with fewer parameter updates, focusing on a subset of the model. It strikes a balance between accuracy and resource usage, offering improvements over prompt engineering with manageable data and computational demands.
* **Prompt engineering** manipulates the input to an LLM to steer its output, without altering the model’s parameters. It’s the least resource-intensive method, suitable for applications with limited data and computational resources.
* **RAG** enhances LLM prompts with information from external databases, effectively a sophisticated form of prompt engineering.

It’s not about using one technique or another. In fact, these techniques can be used in tandem. For example, PEFT might be integrated into a RAG system for further refinement of the LLM or embedding model. The best approach depends on the application’s specific requirements, balancing accuracy, resource availability, and computational constraints.

For more information about customization techniques that you can use to improve domain-specific accuracy, see [Selecting Large Language Model Customization Techniques](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning/blog/selecting-large-language-model-customization-techniques).

When building an application with LLMs, start by implementing RAG to enhance the model’s responses with external information. This approach quickly improves relevance and depth. Later, model customization techniques as outlined earlier, can be employed if you need more domain-specific accuracy. This two-step process balances quick deployment with RAG and targeted improvements through model customization with efficient development and continuous enhancement strategies.

### How to increase RAG accuracy without fine-tuning?

This question deserves not just its own post but several posts. In short, obtaining accuracy in enterprise solutions that leverage RAG is crucial, and fine-tuning is just one technique that may (or may not) improve accuracy in a RAG system.

First and foremost, find a way to measure your RAG accuracy. If you don’t know where you’re beginning, you won’t know how to improve. There are several frameworks for evaluating RAG systems, such as Ragas, ARES, and Bench.

After you have done some evaluation for accuracy, there are numerous places to look to improve the accuracy that does not require fine-tuning. 

Although it may sound trivial, first check to make sure that your data is being parsed and loaded correctly in the first place. For example, if documents contain tables or even images, certain data loaders may miss information in documents. 

After data is ingested, it is chunked. This is the process of splitting text into segments. A chunk can be a fixed character length, but there are various chunking methods, such as sentence splitting and recursive chunking. How text is chunked determines how it is stored in an embedding vector for retrieval.

On top of this, there are many indexing and associated retrieval patterns. For example, several indexes can be constructed for various kinds of user questions and a user query can be routed according to an LLM to the appropriate index.

There are also a variety of retrieval strategies. The most rudimentary strategy is using cosine similarity with an index, but BM25, custom retrievers, or knowledge graphs can also improve the retrieval.

Reranking of results from the retriever can also provide additional flexibility and accuracy improvements according to unique requirements. Query transformations can work well to break down more complex questions. Even just changing the LLM’s system prompt can drastically change accuracy.

At the end of the day, it’s important to take time to experiment and measure the changes in accuracy that various approaches provide.

Remember, models like the LLM or embedding model are merely a part of a RAG system. There are many ways to improve RAG systems to achieve high accuracy without doing any fine-tuning.

### How to connect LLMs to data sources?

There are a variety of frameworks for connecting LLMs to your data sources, such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. These frameworks provide a variety of features, like evaluation libraries, document loaders, and query methods. New solutions are also coming out all the time. We recommend reading about various frameworks and picking the software and components of the software that make the most sense for your application.

### Can RAG cite references for the data that it retrieves? 

Yes. In fact, it improves the user experience if you can cite references for retrieved data. In the AI chatbot RAG workflow example found in the /NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples GitHub repo, we show how to link back to source documents.

### What type of data is needed for RAG? How to secure data?

Right now, textual data is well supported for RAG. Support in RAG systems for other forms of data like images and tables is improving as more research into multi-modal use cases progresses. You may have to write additional tools for data preprocessing depending on your data and where it’s located. There are a variety of data loaders available from LlamaHub and LangChain. For more information about building enriched pipelines with chains, see Security LLM Systems Against Prompt Injection.

Securing data, particularly for an enterprise, is paramount. For example, some indexed data may be intended for only a particular set of users. Role-based access control (RBAC), which restricts access to a system depending on roles, can provide data access control. For example, a user session token can be used in the request to the vector database so that information that’s out of scope for that user’s permissions is not returned. 

A lot of the terms for securing a model in the environment are the same as you might use for securing a database or other critical asset. Think about how your system will log activities—the prompt inputs, outputs, and error results—that are the results of production pipelines. These may provide a rich set of data for product training and improvement, but also a source of data leaks like PII that must be carefully managed just as you are managing the model pipelines themselves. 

AI models have many common patterns to cloud deployments. You should take every advantage of tools like RBAC, rate limiting, and other controls common in those environments to make your AI deployments more robust. Models are just one element of these powerful pipelines. For more information, see Best Practices for Securing LLM Enabled Applications

One aspect important in any LLM deployment is the nature of interaction with your end users. So much of RAG pipelines are centered on the natural language inputs and outputs. Consider ways to ensure that the experience meets consistent expectations through input/output moderation. 

People can ask questions in many different ways. You can give your LLM a helping hand through tools like NeMo Guardrails, which can provide secondary checks on inputs and outputs to ensure that your system runs in tip-top shape, addresses questions it was built for, and helpfully guides users elsewhere for questions that the LLM application isn’t built to handle.

### How to accelerate a RAG pipeline?

RAG systems consist of many components, so there are ample opportunities to accelerate a RAG pipeline:

* **Data preprocessing**
    * Deduplication is the process of identifying and removing duplicate data. In the context of RAG data preprocessing, deduplication can be used to reduce the number of identical documents that must be indexed for retrieval. 
    * NVIDIA NeMo Data Curator uses NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate deduplication by performing min hashing, Jaccard similarity computing, and connected component analysis in parallel. This can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to deduplicate a large dataset.
    * Another opportunity is chunking. Dividing a large text corpus into smaller, more manageable chunks must be done because the downstream embedding model can only encode sentences below the maximum length. Popular embedding models such as OpenAI can encode up to 1536 tokens. If the text has more tokens, it is simply truncated.
    * NVIDIA cuDF can be used to accelerate chunking by performing parallel data frame operations on the GPU. This can significantly reduce the amount of time required to chunk a large corpus.
    * Lastly, you can accelerate a tokenizer on the GPU. Tokenizers are responsible for converting text into integers as tokens, which are then used by the embedding model. The process of tokenizing text can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.

* **Indexing and retrieval**
    * The generation of embeddings is frequently a recurring process since RAG is well-suited for knowledge bases that are frequently updated. Retrieval is done at inference time, so low latency is a requirement. These processes can be accelerated by NVIDIA NeMo Retriever. NeMo Retriever aims to provide state-of-the-art, commercially ready models and microservices, optimized for the lowest latency and highest throughput.

* **LLM inference**
    * At a minimum, an LLM is used for the generation of a fully formed response. LLMs can also be used for tasks such as query decomposition and routing. 
    * With several calls to an LLM, low latency for the LLM is crucial. NVIDIA NeMo includes TensorRT-LLM for model deployment, which optimizes the LLM to achieve both ground-breaking inference acceleration and GPU efficiency. 

### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an approach that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the performance of **NLP** tasks. In RAG, a retriever component first searches through a large corpus of documents to find relevant information based on the input query. Then, a generative model uses this retrieved information to generate a response or output. This two-step process allows RAG to leverage both the precision of retrieval methods and the flexibility of generative models. Therefore, it is particularly effective for tasks that require understanding and generating natural language based on external knowledge.

---

### Can you explain the basic difference between RAG and traditional language models?

**Traditional language models**, like **GPT-3**, generate text based on the patterns and structures they have learned from training data. They cannot retrieve specific information from external sources but generate responses based on the input they receive.

On the other hand, RAG incorporates a retrieval component. It first searches for relevant information from a corpus of documents before generating a response.

## Can you provide an example of bias in Prompt Engineering, and how would you address it?
One example of bias in Prompt Engineering can be seen when a prompt consistently produces outputs that reflect stereotypical or gender biased outputs.

For example, if a prompt suggests a gender-specific role such as “Describe a nurse,” and the model predominantly generates responses indicating the nurse is female, this reflects a gender bias.

To address this bias, prompt engineers can rephrase the prompt to be more inclusive, such as “Describe a person who is a nurse,” and ensure diverse examples are part of the training data throughout the prompt development process. Additionally, continuous evaluation and tuning of prompts can help mitigate such biases, promoting balanced and unbiased outputs from the models.

## As a prompt engineer, how will you avoid bias in prompt engineering?
As a prompt engineer, I will be so mindful and intentional in avoiding bias while creating and testing prompts. Here are some steps I follow.

- **Neutral Language:** I start by using neutral and inclusive language in my prompts. Instead of assuming characteristics like gender, race, or role, I frame my prompts in a way that doesn’t suggest a specific bias. For example, instead of asking for the “best man for the job,” I use “best person for the job.”
- **Diverse Data:** I ensure that the training data used is diverse and representative of multiple perspectives. This means including examples from different genders, ethnicities, social backgrounds, and other demographics. By incorporating a wide range of experiences and viewpoints, I can help create prompts that are more balanced and less likely to perpetuate biases.
- **Regular Testing:** I conduct regular testing of my models to check for biased outputs. I present my prompts to the model and review the responses for any patterns that indicate bias. This ongoing evaluation helps me identify and address any issues, ensuring that the prompts generate fair and balanced outputs.
- **Seek Feedback:** I collect feedback from a diverse group of people to understand how different communities perceive the prompts and their outputs. This can highlight biases that I might not have noticed. By incorporating insights from individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives, I can make more informed adjustments to my prompts, fostering more equitable and inclusive results.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Prompt engineering is not a one-time task. I continuously evaluate and adjust my prompts based on new information, feedback, and advancements in understanding bias. This iterative process helps in catching and correcting biases over time.

I follow these steps to reduce the chances of bias and create more balanced outputs from language models.

## What is the importance of transfer learning in Prompt Engineering?
Transfer learning is like building on someone else’s knowledge to improve our own task.

In Prompt Engineering, this means using a pre-trained language model that has already learned a lot from a huge amount of text. Instead of starting from scratch, we take this pre-trained model and tweak it with specific Prompts tailored to our needs.

This helps the model perform better on our particular task without needing as much time, data, or computational resources.

Essentially, transfer learning allows us to leverage prior learning to get quicker and more efficient results for our Prompt Engineering projects.

## Explain the trade-offs between rule-based Prompts and data-driven Prompts.
Rule-based Prompts are manually constructed using predefined rules and patterns tailored to specific tasks, ensuring precise control over the model’s output. They are generally easier to implement and debug since their logic is transparent. However, they may struggle with scalability and adaptability, as they require extensive manual adjustments to handle diverse or evolving data.
